# slot_finder
 I have created a python script which helps in finding the vaccine slots by alerting you with a SOUNDðŸ”Š "VACCINE SLOT IS AVAILABLE". I have used existing cowin API (API setu) which allows us for tracking the vaccine slots availability and vaccine center along with its name.This CANNOT book slots automatically. The Indian Government had blocked the API for crawlers.
